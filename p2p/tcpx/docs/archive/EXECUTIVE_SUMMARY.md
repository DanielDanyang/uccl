# Executive Summary - TCPX P2P Performance Investigation

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Investigation**: IRQ Binding and CPU Affinity Analysis  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## TL;DR

**Question**: Why does NCCL achieve 19.176 GB/s bus bandwidth while P2P achieves only 2.75 GB/s?

**Answer**: 
- ❌ **NOT** due to IRQ affinity (NCCL uses default IRQ distribution)
- ✅ **YES** due to thread CPU affinity (NCCL pins threads to NUMA-local cores)
- ✅ **YES** due to multi-NIC parallelism (NCCL uses 4 NICs, P2P uses 1)
- ✅ **YES** due to process architecture (NCCL: 1 process enables NIC sharing)

**Recommendation**: 
1. Add thread CPU affinity to P2P (quick win, 10-30% improvement)
2. Evaluate single-process architecture (enables multi-NIC, 2-4x improvement)
3. Do NOT waste time on IRQ affinity tuning

---

## Key Findings

### 1. IRQ Affinity is NOT the Bottleneck ❌

**Evidence**:
- NCCL does NOT set custom IRQ affinity (`NCCL_GPUDIRECTTCPX_TX/RX_IRQ_BINDINGS = null`)
- All gVNIC IRQs use default round-robin distribution (CPUs 1-64)
- eth3/eth4 IRQs are on NUMA 0 CPUs (33-48) but NCCL threads are on NUMA 1 CPUs (60-87)
- Despite this NUMA mismatch, NCCL achieves 19.176 GB/s bus bandwidth

**Conclusion**: IRQ affinity optimization is NOT necessary for high performance.

### 2. Thread CPU Affinity IS Important ✅

**Evidence**:
- NCCL sets `NCCL_GPUDIRECTTCPX_TX_BINDINGS` and `RX_BINDINGS`
- TX threads pinned to cores 8-21, 112-125 (NUMA 0) and 60-73, 164-177 (NUMA 1)
- RX threads pinned to cores 22-35, 126-139 (NUMA 0) and 74-87, 178-191 (NUMA 1)
- All cores are NUMA-local to their NICs
- P2P benchmark does NOT set any thread affinity

**Recommendation**: Add thread CPU affinity to P2P benchmark (easy, high impact).

### 3. Multi-NIC Parallelism IS Critical ✅

**Evidence**:
- NCCL uses all 4 NICs simultaneously (~128 GB transferred per NIC during test)
- P2P uses only 1 NIC per GPU
- NCCL's single-process architecture enables NIC sharing across GPUs
- P2P's multi-process architecture causes devmem conflicts when sharing NICs

**Recommendation**: Evaluate single-process architecture to enable multi-NIC.

### 4. Process Architecture Matters ✅

**NCCL Architecture**:
- 1 process per node
- 8 GPUs per process
- All 4 NICs visible to the process
- 16 channels total (8 per GPU)
- No devmem conflicts

**P2P Architecture**:
- 8 processes per node
- 1 GPU per process
- 1 NIC per process
- 1 channel per GPU
- Devmem conflicts when sharing NICs

**Recommendation**: Consider refactoring to single-process architecture.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | P2P (Current) | NCCL | Gap |
|--------|---------------|------|-----|
| **Bandwidth** | 2.75 GB/s/GPU | 19.176 GB/s bus BW | ~7x |
| **NICs used** | 1 | 4 | 4x |
| **Channels** | 1/GPU | 8/GPU | 8x |
| **Process arch** | 8 processes | 1 process | Different |
| **Thread affinity** | None | NUMA-local | Different |
| **IRQ affinity** | Default | Default | **Same** |

## Recommended Optimization Path

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days, 20-50% improvement)
1. ✅ Add thread CPU affinity (export `NCCL_GPUDIRECTTCPX_TX/RX_BINDINGS`)
2. ✅ Tune window size (`UCCL_TCPX_WINDOW_SIZE`)
3. ✅ Tune chunk size (`UCCL_TCPX_CHUNK_BYTES`)

**Target**: >3.5 GB/s (server) or >1.5 GB/s (client) per GPU

### Phase 2: Architecture Evaluation (2-3 days)
1. ✅ Prototype single-process P2P (1 process, 8 GPUs)
2. ✅ Test multi-NIC capability (check for devmem conflicts)
3. ✅ Compare architectures and decide path forward

**Decision point**: If single-process enables multi-NIC, proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Full Optimization (3-5 days, 4-8x improvement)
1. ✅ Implement multi-NIC P2P (use all 4 NICs)
2. ✅ Implement multi-channel (4-8 channels per GPU)
3. ✅ Final tuning and optimization

**Target**: >15 GB/s bus bandwidth (within 20% of NCCL)

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Do NOT tune IRQ affinity** - NCCL doesn't use it, not necessary  
❌ **Do NOT align IRQs to threads** - NCCL has NUMA mismatches, still works  
❌ **Do NOT try multi-NIC with current architecture** - Known to fail (devmem conflicts)  
❌ **Do NOT increase channels on single NIC** - Known to degrade performance

## Questions Answered

### Q: Should we tune IRQ affinity?
**A**: No. NCCL uses default IRQ distribution and achieves high performance.

### Q: Should we align IRQs to thread cores?
**A**: No. NCCL has NUMA mismatches (eth3/eth4 IRQs on NUMA 0, threads on NUMA 1) and still works.

### Q: Should we set thread CPU affinity?
**A**: Yes! NCCL pins threads to NUMA-local cores. This is easy to add and likely to help.

### Q: Can we use multiple NICs per GPU with current architecture?
**A**: No. Multi-process architecture causes devmem conflicts. Need single-process architecture.

### Q: What's the fastest path to high performance?
**A**: 
1. Add thread CPU affinity (quick win)
2. Evaluate single-process architecture (enables multi-NIC)
3. Implement multi-NIC + multi-channel (approach NCCL performance)

### Q: How long will optimization take?
**A**: 6-8 days total (1-2 days Phase 1, 2-3 days Phase 2, 3-5 days Phase 3)
