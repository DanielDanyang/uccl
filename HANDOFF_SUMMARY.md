# Project Handoff Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Project**: NIXL-TCPX Plugin Development  
**Workspace**: `/home/daniel/uccl`

## üìã What Was Done

### 1. Investigated Multi-Channel Performance Issue
- **Problem**: Increasing channels from 1 to 4 degraded performance (1.17 GB/s ‚Üí 0.43 GB/s)
- **Root Cause**: All 4 channels were created on the same NIC (only 1 device detected)
- **Why**: `NCCL_GPUDIRECTTCPX_SOCKET_IFNAME` was set to single NIC per process
- **Attempted Fix**: Modified to expose 2 NICs per GPU (eth1+eth2 for GPU 0-3)
- **Result**: FAILED - devmem resource conflicts when multiple GPU processes use same NIC

### 2. Analyzed Multi-NIC Failure
- **Symptom**: "rx no cmsg" errors on second channel for each GPU pair
- **Pattern**: GPU 0-1 both use eth2 ‚Üí conflict; GPU 2-3 both use eth1 ‚Üí conflict
- **Root Cause**: TCPX devmem registration appears to be process-exclusive per NIC
- **Conclusion**: Current architecture (8 processes, 1 GPU each) cannot share NICs

### 3. Compared with NCCL Architecture
- **NCCL**: 1 process, 8 GPUs, all 4 NICs visible, 8 channels per GPU
- **P2P**: 8 processes, 1 GPU each, 1 NIC per process, 1 channel per GPU
- **Key Difference**: NCCL's single-process architecture allows NIC sharing
- **NCCL Bindings**: Explicit IRQ/CPU affinity via `NCCL_GPUDIRECTTCPX_TX/RX_BINDINGS`

### 4. Developed IRQ Binding Investigation Plan
- **Hypothesis**: NCCL's performance advantage may come from IRQ/CPU affinity
- **Created**: `p2p/tcpx/docs/IRQ_BINDING_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md`
- **Plan**: 6-step systematic investigation (data collection ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing)
- **Timeline**: 11-17 hours estimated

### 5. Enhanced NCCL Test Script with Diagnostics
- **Modified**: `collective/rdma/run_nccl_test_tcpx.sh`
- **Added**: Comprehensive diagnostics collection (6th parameter)
- **Collects**: IRQ snapshots, CPU usage, NUMA topology, NIC stats, NCCL logs
- **Usage**: `./run_nccl_test_tcpx.sh nccl 2 8 0 1 1` (last param=1)
- **Output**: `diagnostics/nccl_<timestamp>/` with 13+ data files

### 6. Updated All Documentation for Handoff
- **Updated**: `p2p/tcpx/docs/AI_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` - Complete rewrite for current status
- **Updated**: `p2p/tcpx/docs/DEBUG_ETH2_RX_NO_CMSG.md` - Added resolution summary
- **Created**: `p2p/tcpx/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive project overview
- **Created**: `p2p/tcpx/docs/IRQ_BINDING_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed investigation plan
- **Created**: `p2p/tcpx/README.md` - Quick start guide
- **Created**: `HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## üöÄ Next Steps for Handoff Recipient

### Immediate Actions (Step 1: Data Collection)

1. **Run NCCL diagnostics collection** (~30 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd /home/daniel/uccl/collective/rdma
   ./run_nccl_test_tcpx.sh nccl 2 8 0 1 1
   ```

2. **Review diagnostics output**
   ```bash
   # Find latest diagnostics
   ls -lt /home/daniel/uccl/diagnostics/ | head -5
   
   # View summary
   cat /home/daniel/uccl/diagnostics/nccl_*/SUMMARY.txt
   
   # View key metrics
   cat /home/daniel/uccl/diagnostics/nccl_*/nccl_metrics_summary.txt
   ```

3. **Analyze IRQ and CPU data** (~1-2 hours)
   - Build IRQ-to-NIC-to-CPU mapping table (see investigation plan Step 2.1)
   - Document NCCL's actual CPU usage patterns
   - Compare with P2P baseline

### Follow-Up Actions (Steps 2-6)

4. **Design binding policy** (~1 hour)
   - Based on diagnostics data
   - See investigation plan Step 2

5. **Implement bindings** (~2-3 hours)
   - Create IRQ affinity setup script
   - Modify `run_p2p_fullmesh.sh`
   - See investigation plan Step 3

6. **Test and measure** (~2-3 hours)
   - Run test matrix (5 configurations)
   - Collect performance metrics
   - See investigation plan Step 4

7. **Iterate and document** (~2-4 hours)
   - Refine based on results
   - Create `IRQ_BINDING_RESULTS.md`
   - See investigation plan Steps 5-6

## üîß Recommended Actions Before Handoff

### 1. Revert run_p2p_fullmesh.sh to Working Config

The current config (2 NICs per GPU) is broken. Revert to single-NIC:

```bash
cd /home/daniel/uccl/p2p/tcpx

# Edit run_p2p_fullmesh.sh:
# - Change CHANNELS back to 1
# - Change map_gpu_to_ifaces() back to single NIC per GPU:
#   0|1) echo "eth1" ;;
#   2|3) echo "eth2" ;;
#   4|5) echo "eth3" ;;
#   6|7) echo "eth4" ;;
```

### 2. Verify Working Config

```bash
# Node 0
./run_p2p_fullmesh.sh server

# Node 1
./run_p2p_fullmesh.sh client <NODE0_ETH0_IP>

# Expected: ~2.75 GB/s server, ~1.17 GB/s client
```

### 3. Run NCCL Diagnostics

```bash
cd /home/daniel/uccl/collective/rdma
./run_nccl_test_tcpx.sh nccl 2 8 0 1 1

# Verify diagnostics collected successfully
ls -l /home/daniel/uccl/diagnostics/nccl_*/
```

## üîë Key Insights to Remember

1. **Loopback doesn't work** - Always test on separate nodes
2. **ethtool rx_devmem_pkts is ground truth** - Confirms devmem is active
3. **NCCL proves environment works** - Don't debug system-level issues
4. **Process architecture matters** - 8 processes can't share NICs (devmem conflicts)
5. **Measure before optimizing** - Collect data first, then decide
6. **Document negative results** - Knowing what doesn't work is valuable
