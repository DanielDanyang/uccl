# Incast Benchmark

This benchmark is done on a local 2 HGX testbed each with 8xH100 GPUs and 8x400G CX-7 IB NICs. These two servers are under the same rack. 
Our results show severe interference between incast traffic and permutation traffic, see Figure 9 in our [technique report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17307).
